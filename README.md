jReader

Java-GWT alternative to Google Reader

Now it's almost functional - you can add categrois, items and import OPML.
Also items can ba marked is read.
Scheduled updates are not implemented (as well as manual, actually)

I use several dependencies manually installed dependencies in project - please contact me if you need them.

I didn't find any normal library for parsing OPML, so I've written parser based on simple xml - (just copied specs to POJOs actually)

Any help is appreciated.

What I need right now:

someone who can design things in GWT
someone who can set up keyboard-based navigation.
